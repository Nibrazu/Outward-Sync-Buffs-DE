## Buffed Buffs  Definitive Edition 

 - This is a slighlty tuned version of the mod " Longer Buffs - DE - English version by ScarJaguar https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ScarJaguar/LongerBuffsEnglish/ " as I felt the original was too powerful.
- My focus was to improve QoL by synchronizing effect timers rather than making them absurdly long.

## Changes from Longer Buffs

 - Rags from 600s to 300s
 - Varnishes from 900s to 600s
 - Boons from 600s to 300s
 - Amplified Boons from 900s to 600s
 - Any potion effect with 2 levels has lvl 1 with 300s and lvl 2 with 600s
 - Elemental Imunity from 600s to 30s (vanilla is 15s and 600s is an insane time) 
 - Energized from 600s to 300s
 - Speed up from 600s to 300s
 - Runic magic from 600s to 300s
 - Amplified Runic magic from 900s to 600s
 - Added Infusions set to 300s (vanilla is 180s)

## Conflicts

 - Since I added Infusions this mod is not compatible with mod classfixes since I don't use them. If requested I'll upload another mod without Infusions.
