## Buffed Buffs Definitive Edition 

- This is a slighlty tuned version of the mod " Longer Buffs - DE - English version by ScarJaguar https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/ScarJaguar/LongerBuffsEnglish/ " as I felt the original was too powerful
- Extends buffs of magic boons from 240 seconds to 300 seconds (5 minutes) and extends their amplified versions to 600 seconds (10 minutes).
- Extends rag imbues from 90 seconds to 180 seconds (3 minutes), varnish imbues from 180 seconds to 600 seconds (5 minutes).
